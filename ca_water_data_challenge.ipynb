    "# 1: Understanding the data gaps: visualizing the quantity & quality of existing data\n",
    "Rafael Maestu\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year, public water systems are required to submit an annual report that includes information such as water quantity used, sources of water, water fees charged, water quality violations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reporting is now electronic through a webform, but data is not always usable (e.g., someone enters in a text string instead of a number) or complete (fields may be blank). The focus has been on collecting the annual reports but time and resources limits the ability to correct data gaps. As a result, the use of the data reported is limited.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### This project will work to visualize the problem, making a case for change. \n",
    "\n",
    "- How might we redesign or shape paths for effective data collection and analysis for this required water quality reporting?\n",
    "- What percentage of records could be considered complete or accurate? \n",
    "- What system checks can we include to minimize data gaps? \n",
